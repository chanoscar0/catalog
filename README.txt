Place your catalog project in this directory.

In order to begin the project, you must first run the Vagrant Machine.

Make sure you are in the correct directory before starting.

When in the Vagrant Folder, use Vagrant Up and Vagrant SSH to get the VM up and
running.

After Vagrant is ready, CD into the directory /catalog on the Virtual Machine

When CDed, run application.py and report to localhost:8000 on your computer.

There, the functionality should be present.
